    <td>The strategies that are effective are listening closely to what Mr.Keen says, Sometimes i learn from the people around me aswell if i don't understand i will sometimes ask them for help on what to do so then I can do what we should be doing. And not arguing with the other person that im doing my work with because that will just slow us down and not help in anway
