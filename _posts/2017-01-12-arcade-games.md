Snake- in this i learnt you can make a sprite move like this I_____I  instead of it all changing direction so it's like this -----------------------------8

Donkey kong- you can make something roll down something else.

Pacman- you can get villains (ghosts) to not go straight at you but you can make them go in your direction

 Space invaders- you can make it so that only villains (aliens) on the front row will shoot

Tetris - you can make things gradually fall down and at the same time you can make them go down faster.

What needs to happen:

Lives

Levels

Difficulty

Objective

Where is it set?
